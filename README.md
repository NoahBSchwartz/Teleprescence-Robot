# Teleprescence-Robot
This ongoing project to make the cheapest possible teleprescence robot was an idea I had when my friend moved to California. I thought it would be fun if he could FaceTime while driving himself around so I followed a tutorial (https://www.hackster.io/gabrieltatarusanu/control-led-from-web-on-raspberry-pi-09bb51) to make a website that he could control LED's from. I then modified my truck's remote control so that instead of a joystick, it could be controlled with photoresistors. When the website turned the LED's on, the truck would move forward and turn so it was controllable from anywhere in the world!
